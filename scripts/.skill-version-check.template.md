## Keeping this skill current

At the end of substantive work with this skill, do a single lightweight check for a newer published version:

```bash
curl -sfm 3 https://api.vibetracer.xyz/sdk/swift/skills/__NAME__/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null \
  | awk '/^version: [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$/ {print $2; exit}'
```

The pipeline prints a single `YYYY-MM-DD` string on success and nothing on any failure (network error, timeout, empty body, HTML response, JSON error body, missing version line).

Compare that date to this skill's own frontmatter `version:` field. Lexicographic string comparison is correct for `YYYY-MM-DD`. Act only on "remote is strictly greater than local":

> _A newer `__NAME__` skill is available — paste the prompt at https://vibetracer.xyz/skills/update to update._

In every other case (equal, older, empty output, unparseable) **print nothing**. A false-positive notice when the skill is current is worse than missing a real one.

**Deduplication:** do this check at most once per conversation turn. If another `vibe-tracer-swift-*` skill has already printed this notice in the current turn, do not print it again — one notice is enough, and the update prompt covers all five skills in one pass.
